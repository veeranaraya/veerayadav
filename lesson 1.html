        <h1>Performance & Organization </h1>

       <p> Having the ability to write HTML and CSS with a solid understanding is a great expertise <br>
         to have. As a website’s code base and traffic grows, a new skill set comes into play, one <br>
          that is extremely important to both development time and user experience. Knowing <br>
           the fundamentals of website performance and organization can go a long way.</p>

<p>The organization and architecture of a code base can greatly affect not only the speed <br>
     of development, but also the speed at which pages render. Both of which can be <br>
      sizeable concerns not only for developers but also users. Taking the time to design the <br>
       right structure for a code base, and identify how all of the different components will <br>
        work together, can speed up production and make for a better experience all around.</p>

<p>Additionally, taking a few small steps to improve the performance of a website can pay <br>
     off in dividends. Website performance greatly resembles the 80/20 rule, where 20% of <br>
      the optimizations will speed up roughly 80% of the website.</p>

<h1 id="veera">Strategy & Structure</h1>
<p>The first part to improving a website’s performance and organization revolves around <br>
     identifying a good strategy and structure for developing the code base. Specifically,<br>
      building a strong directory architecture, outlining design patterns, and finding ways to <br>
       reuse common code.</p>

 <h1>Style Architecture</h1>
<p>Exactly how to organize styles boils down to personal preference and what is best for a <br>
     given website but generally speaking there are best practices to follow. One practice <br>
      includes separating styles based on intent, which includes creating directories for <br>
       common base styles, user interface components, and business logic modules.</p>

       <p>The architecture outlined above includes three directories, all with individual groups of <br>
         styles. The goal here is to start thinking of websites as systems rather than individual <br>
          pages, and the code architecture should reflect this mindset. Notice how there aren’t <br>
          any page specific styles here.</p>

<p>The base directory includes common styles and variables to be used across the entire <br>
     website, layout and typography styles for example. The components directory includes <br>
      styles for specific user interface elements which are broken down into different <br>
       component files such as alerts and buttons. Lastly, the modules directory includes <br>
        styles for different sections of a page, which are determined by business needs.</p>

<p>The component styles are purely interface driven and have nothing to do with the core <br>
     business logic of the website. Modules then include styles specific to the business logic. <br>
      When marking up a module in HTML it is common to use different user interface <br>
       components within it. For example, the sidebar of a page may have list and button styles <br>
        that are defined within component styles while other styles needed for the sidebar are <br>
         inherited from the module style. The separation of style encourages well thought out <br>
          presets and the ability for styles to be widely shared and reused.</p>

<p>The strategy of organizing styles this way isn’t exactly new, and has been previously <br>
     mentioned in different CSS methodologies including Object Oriented CSS, OOCSS, and <br>
      the Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS, SMACSS. These methodologies have <br>
       their own opinions on structure, as well as on how to use styles.</p>

<h1>Object Oriented CSS</h1>
<p>The Object Oriented CSS methodology was pioneered by Nicole Sullivan in her work <br>
     with writing styles for larger websites. Object Oriented CSS identifies two principles that <br>
      will help build scalable websites with a strong architecture and a reasonable amount of <br>
       code. These two principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate structure from skin</li>
<li>Separate content from container</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall separating structure from skin includes abstracting the layout of an element <br>
     away from the theme of a website. The structure of a module should be transparent, <br>
      allowing other styles to be inherited and displayed without conflict. Most commonly <br>
       this requires a solid grid and layout structure, along with well crafted modules.</p>

<p>Separating content from the container involves removing the dependency of a parent <br>
     element nesting children elements. A heading should look the same regardless of its <br>
      parent container. To accomplish this, elements need to inherit default styles, then be <br>
       extended with multiple classes as necessary.</p>

      <h1 id="veera"> Image Compression</h1>
<p>Cutting down the size of a text file helps, but you get even better results by compressing <br>
     the file size of images. The total file size of all the images across a website can quickly <br>
      add up, and compressing images will greatly help keep the file size under control.</p>

<p>Many people steer away from compressing images in fear that compression involves <br>
     reducing the quality of the image itself. For the most part this is incorrect, and images <br>
      can be compressed in a lossless fashion, allowing unnecessary color profiles and <br>
       comments to be removed from the image without changing the quality of the image at all.</p>

<p>There are a handful of tools to help compress images, two of the best are ImageOptim <br>
     for Mac and PNGGauntlet for Windows. Both of these services compress the most <br>
      commonly used image formats, specifically JPG and PNG files.</p>
