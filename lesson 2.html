    <p>Lesson 2</p>
    <h1>Getting to Know HTML</h1>
    <p>When it comes to building layouts and positioning content on a page there are a handful <br>
       of different techniques to use. Which technique to use largely depends on the content <br>
        and the goals of the page, as some techniques may be better than others.</p>

<p>For example, the ability to float elements side by side provides a nice, clean layout that <br>
   is receptive to the different elements on a page. However, when more strict control <br>
    is needed, elements may be positioned using other techniques, including relative <br>
     or absolute positioning.</p>

<p>In this lesson, we’ll start by taking a look at how to contain floats. Following that, we’ll <br>
   cover more detailed positioning techniques, including how to precisely position <br>
    elements on both the x and y axis as well as the z axis.</p>

    <h1 id="veera">Semantics Overview</h1>
<p>So what exactly are semantics? Semantics within HTML is the practice of giving content <br>
   on the page meaning and structure by using the proper element. Semantic code <br>
    describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style or appearance of that <br>
     content. There are several benefits to using semantic elements, including enabling <br>
      computers, screen readers, search engines, and other devices to adequately read and <br>
       understand the content on a web page. Additionally, semantic HTML is easier to <br>
        manage and work with, as it shows clearly what each piece of content is about.</p>

<p>Moving forward, as new elements are introduced, we’ll talk about what those elements <br>
   actually mean and the type of content they best represent. Before we do that, though, <br>
    let’s look at two elements that actually don’t hold any semantic <br>
       value. They exist for styling purposes only.</p>

<h1>Identifying Divisions & Spans</h1>
 <p>Divisions are HTML elements that act as containers solely for <br>
   styling purposes. As generic containers, they do not come with any overarching <br>
    meaning or semantic value. Paragraphs are semantic in that content wrapped within a <br>
     <p> element is known and understood as a paragraph. do not hold <br>
       any such meaning and are simply containers.</p>

      <h1> Using Text-Based Elements</h1>
 <p>Many different forms of media and content exist online; however, text is predominant. <br>
   Accordingly, there are a number of different elements for displaying text on a web page. <br>
    For now we’ll focus on the more popular elements, including headings, paragraphs, bold <br>
     text to show importance, and italics for emphasis. Later, within Lesson 6, “Working with <br>
      Typography,” we’ll take a closer look at how to style text.</p>

  <h3 id="veera">Headings</h3>
<p>Headings are block-level elements, and they come in six different rankings, <br>
   through. Headings help to quickly break up content and establish hierarchy, and <br>
     they are key identifiers for users reading a page. They also help search engines to index <br>
      and determine the content on a page.</p>

<p>Headings should be used in an order that is relevant to the content of a page. The primary heading of a page or section should be marked up with an  element, and subsequent headings should use elements as necessary.</p>

<p>Each heading level should be used where it is semantically valued, and should not be used to make text bold or big—there are other, better ways to do that.</p>

<p>Here is an example of HTML for all the different heading levels and the resulting display on a web page.</p>

    <div>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Tag names</th>
          <th>Tag size</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>h1</td>
          <td>32px</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>h2</td>
          <td>24px</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>h3</td>
          <td>18.72px</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>h4</td>
          <td>16px</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>h5</td>
          <td>13.28px</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>h6</td>
          <td>10.72px</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
