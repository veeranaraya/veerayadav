        <h1>Building Forms</h1>
        <p>Forms are an essential part of the Internet, as they provide a way for websites to capture information from users and to process requests, and they offer controls for nearly every imaginable use of an application. Through controls or fields, forms can request a small amount of information—often a search query or a username and password—or a large amount of information—perhaps shipping and billing information or an entire job application.</p>

        <p>We need to know how to build forms in order to acquire user input. In this lesson we’ll discuss how to use HTML to mark up a form, which elements to use to capture different types of data, and how to style forms with CSS. We won’t get too deep into how information from a form is processed and handled on the back end of a website. Form processing is a deeper topic, outside the realm of this book; for now we’ll stick to the creation and styling of forms.</p>

<h1>Initializing a Form</h1>
<p>To add a form to a page, we’ll use the element. The element identifies where on the page control elements will appear. Additionally, the element will wrap all of the elements included within the form, much like a element.</p>

<p>A handful of different attributes can be applied to the <form> element, the most common of which are action and method. The action attribute contains the URL to which information included within the form will be sent for processing by the server. The method attribute is the HTTP method browsers should use to submit the form data. Both of these <form> attributes pertain to submitting and processing data.</p>

  <h2>Text Fields & Textareas</h2>
<p>When it comes to gathering text input from users, there are a few different elements available for obtaining data within forms. Specifically, text fields and textareas are used for collecting text- or string-based data. This data may include passages of text content, passwords, telephone numbers, and other information.</p>
  
  <h3 id="veera">Text Fields</h3>
<p>One of the primary elements used to obtain text from users is the element. The element uses the type attribute to define what type of information is to be captured within the control. The most popular type attribute value is text, which denotes a single line of text input.</p>
  
<p> Along with setting a type attribute, it is best practice to give an element a name attribute as well. The name attribute value is used as the name of the control and is submitted along with the input data to the server.</p>

<h1 id="veera">Multiple Choice Inputs & Menus</h1>
<p>Apart from text-based input controls, HTML also allows users to select data using multiple choice and drop-down lists. There are a few different options and elements for these form controls, each of which has distinctive benefits.</p>

<h2 id="veera">Radio Buttons</h2>
<p>Radio buttons are an easy way to allow users to make a quick choice from a small list of options. Radio buttons permit users to select one option only, as opposed to multiple options.</p>

<p>To create a radio button, the element is used with a type attribute value of radio. Each radio button element should have the same name attribute value so that all of the buttons within a group correspond to one another.</p>

<p>With text-based inputs, the value of an input is determined by what a user types in; with radio buttons a user is making a multiple choice selection. Thus, we have to define the input value. Using the value attribute, we can set a specific value for each element.</p>
