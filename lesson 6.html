        <h1>Working with Typography</h1>
       <p> The field of web typography has grown substantially over time. There are a couple of different reasons for its rise in popularity; one widely acknowledged reason is the development of a system for embedding our own web fonts on a website.</p>

      <p>In the past we were limited to a small number of typefaces that we could use on a website. These typefaces were the most commonly installed fonts on computers, so they were the most likely to render properly on-screen. If a font wasn’t installed on a computer, it wouldn’t render on the website either. Now, with the ability to embed fonts, we have a much larger palette of typefaces to choose from, including those that we add to a website.</p>

    <p>While the ability to embed fonts gives us access to countless new typefaces, it’s also important for us to know the basic principles of typography. In this lesson we’re going to take a look at some of these basic principles and how to apply them to our web pages using HTML and CSS.</p>
       
   <h1> Adding Color to Text</h1>

<p>Typically one of the first decisions we’ll make when building a website is choosing the primary typeface and text color to be used. While there are a number of other properties that can be changed—size, weight, and so on—the typeface and text color generally have the largest impact on the look and legibility of a page. Getting rid of the browser defaults and using our own typeface and text color immediately begins setting the tone of our page.</p>

<p>The only property we need to set the color of text is the color property. The color property accepts one color value, but in many different formats. These formats, as we discussed in Lesson 3, “Getting to Know CSS,” include keywords, hexadecimal values, and RGB, RGBa, HSL, and HSLa values. Hexadecimal values are the most prevalent, as they provide the most control with the least amount of effort.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the CSS required to change the color of all the text within the  element on a page:</p>

<h1>Changing Font Properties</h1>

<p>CSS offers a lot of different properties for editing the look and feel of text on a page. These properties fit into two categories: font-based properties and text-based properties. Most of these properties will be prefaced with either font-* or text-*. To begin we’ll discuss the font-based properties.</p>

<h3 id="veera">Font Family</h3>
<p>The font-family property is used to declare which font—as well as which fallback or substitute fonts—should be used to display text. The value of the font-family property contains multiple font names, all comma separated.</p>

<p>The first declared font, starting from the left, is the primary font choice. Should the first font be unavailable, alternative fonts are declared after it in order of preference from left to right.</p>

<p>Font names consisting of two or more words need to be wrapped in quotation marks. Additionally, the last font should be a keyword value, which will use the system default font for the specified type, most commonly either sans-serif or serif.</p>
