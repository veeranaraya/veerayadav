        <h1>Positioning Content</h1>
        <p>One of the best things about CSS is that it gives us the ability to position content and elements on a page in nearly any imaginable way, bringing structure to our designs and helping make content more digestible.

        <p>There are a few different types of positioning within CSS, and each has its own application. In this chapter we’re going to take a look at a few different use cases—creating reusable layouts and uniquely positioning one-off elements—and describe a few ways to go about each.

<h1>Positioning with Floats</h1>

<p>One way to position elements on a page is with the float property. The float property is pretty versatile and can be used in a number of different ways.</p>

<p>Essentially, the float property allows us to take an element, remove it from the normal flow of a page, and position it to the left or right of its parent element. All other elements on the page will then flow around the floated element. An  element floated to the side of a few paragraphs of text, for example, will allow the paragraphs to wrap around the image as necessary.</p>

<p>When the float property is used on multiple elements at the same time, it provides the ability to create a layout by floating elements directly next to or opposite each other, as seen in multiple-column layouts.</p>

<p>The float property accepts a few values; the two most popular values are left and right, which allow elements to be floated to the left or right of their parent element.</p>

<h1>Clearing & Containing Floats</h1>

<p>The float property was originally designed to allow content to wrap around images. An image could be floated, and all of the content surrounding that image could then naturally flow around it. Although this works great for images, the float property was never actually intended to be used for layout and positioning purposes, and thus it comes with a few pitfalls.</p>

<p>One of those pitfalls is that occasionally the proper styles will not render on an element that it is sitting next to or is a parent element of a floated element. When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the page, and, as a result, the styles of elements around that floated element can be negatively impacted.</p>

<p>Often margin and padding property values aren’t interpreted correctly, causing them to blend into the floated element; other properties can be affected, too.</p>

<p>Another pitfall is that sometimes unwanted content begins to wrap around a floated element. Removing an element from the flow of the document allows all the elements around the floated element to wrap and consume any available space around the floated element, which is often undesired.</p>

<p>With our previous two-column example, after we floated the and elements, and before we set a width property value on either of them, the content within the  element would have wrapped in between the two floated elements above it, filling in any available space. Consequently, the  element would have sat in the gutter between the  and elements, consuming the available space.</p>

<h1>Creating Reusable Layouts</h1>

<p>When building a website, it is always best to write modular styles that may be reused elsewhere, and reusable layouts are high on the list of reusable code. Layouts can be created using either floats or inline-block elements, but which works best and why?</p>

<p>Whether it’s better to use floats or inline-block elements to lay out the structure of a page is open to debate. My approach is to use inline-block elements to create the grid—or layout—of a page and to then use floats when I want content to wrap around a given element (as floats were intended to do with images). Generally, I also find inline-block elements easier to work with.</p>

<p>That said, use whatever works best for you. If you are comfortable with one approach over the other, then go for it.</p>

<p>Currently there are new CSS specifications in the works—specifically flex- and grid- based properties—that will help address how to best lay out pages. Keep an eye out for these methods as they begin to surface.</p>
