        <p>Lesson 4</p>
        <h1>Opening the Box Model</h1>
        <p>We’ve familiarized ourselves with HTML and CSS; we know what they look like and how to accomplish some of the basics. Now we’re going to go a bit deeper and look at exactly how elements are displayed on a page and how they are sized.</p>

          <p>In the process we’ll discuss what is known as the box model and how it works with HTML and CSS. We’re also going to look at a few new CSS properties and use some of the length values we covered in Lesson 3. Let’s begin.</p>
          
          <h2>How Are Elements Displayed?</h2>
        <p>Before jumping into the box model, it helps to understand how elements are displayed. In Lesson 2 we covered the difference between block-level and inline-level elements. To quickly recap, block-level elements occupy any available width, regardless of their content, and begin on a new line. Inline-level elements occupy only the width their content requires and line up on the same line, one after the other. Block-level elements are generally used for larger pieces of content, such as headings and structural elements. Inline-level elements are generally used for smaller pieces of content, such as a few words selected to be bold or italicized.</p>
      
       <h3 id="veera"> Display</h3>
<p>Exactly how elements are displayed—as block-level elements, inline elements, or something else—is determined by the display property. Every element has a default display property value; however, as with all other property values, that value may be overwritten. There are quite a few values for the display property, but the most common are block, inline, inline-block, and none.</p>

<p>We can change an element’s display property value by selecting that element within CSS and declaring a new display property value. A value of block will make that element a block-level element.</p>

<h1 >What Is the Box Model?</h1>
<p>According to the box model concept, every element on a page is a rectangular box and may have width, height, padding, borders, and margins.</p>

<p>That’s worth repeating: Every element on a page is a rectangular box.</p>

<h1 id="veera">Working with the Box Model</h1>
<p>Every element is a rectangular box, and there are several properties that determine the size of that box. The core of the box is defined by the width and height of an element, which may be determined by the display property, by the contents of the element, or by specified width and height properties. padding and then border expand the dimensions of the box outward from the element’s width and height. Lastly, any margin we have specified will follow the border.</p>

<p>Each part of the box model corresponds to a CSS property: width, height, padding, border, and margin.</p>
